<h1 align="center">Kana</h1>
<p align="center">
Kana is a clean, feature-rich Discord bot, and one of the bots (if not the only bot) that integrate with WhatsApp. Coded in <b>Node.js</b> and uses the <b>Sapphire Framework</b> and <b>discord.js</b> to bring you optimal performance, for free.<br>
<i>A continuation of Kohana.</i>
</p>  

### Features
- **WhatsApp:** Most commands that Kana currently has can be run in WhatsApp, as well as Discord, after doing a simple one-time linking of both accounts.  
- **Clean:** There are absolutely no premium subscriptions, which also means no advertisements for them in footers or images of embeds. We also try not to overwhelm the user with information every time a command is executed.  
- **Modern:** Uses the latest version of discord.js and the Sapphire framework, and uses Discord's slash commands, even having autocomplete.  
- **Free:** Kana is, and always will be, completely free to use. No vote-locked commands, no paywalls, no advertisements.  
- **Reliable:** Minimal downtime. (except during major updates)  
- ... and more coming soon!
