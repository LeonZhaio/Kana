## Data collected
- After every track that Kana plays, the "tracks played" count increases by 1.
- After every track that Kana plays, the "duration played" increases by the duration of the track.
- After a command is executed on Kana, the "commands executed" count increases by 1.
- Kana collects the name and artist of every track played. This is going to be used in the future to create statistic pages (top played, etc.). Please take note that this information is not read by any human.

## Opt-out
*You cannot opt out of the small amount of data collection Kana has. A small possibility would be to contact the owner of the bot, and asking for a special case.*
