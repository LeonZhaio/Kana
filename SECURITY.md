# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Anything below version 4 is no longer supported.
When a new version is released, older versions will receive support, but only for MAJOR security issues / dependency updates. There will not be more code changes. 
If something breaks with other versions after a new one is released, it will NOT be fixed.  

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 4.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.x.x   | :x:                |
| < 3.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub Issues to report a vulnerability ([Issues](https://github.com/thaddeuskkr/Kana/issues)). If you find something that you would be able to fix yourself, you are free to fork and edit this code, then open a pull request ([Pull Requests](https://github.com/thaddeuskkr/Kana/pulls)) and wait for your changes to be approved and merged. You will most likely get a response in a few days. If your vulnerability is accepted, you will have my eternal thanks. If you are, however, denied, you can always try again another time.
