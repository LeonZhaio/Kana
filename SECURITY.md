# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Version 3.3.5 is the first release where Docker support is officially added, therefore this will be the start of version releases.  
Anything below version 3.3.5 is no longer supported, and Kana - <= v2 is no longer available for download.  
When a new version is released, older versions will receive support, but only for MAJOR security issues / dependency updates. There will not be more code changes. 
If something breaks with other versions after a new one is released, it will NOT be fixed.  

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 4.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.x.x   | :x:                |
| < 3.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use GitHub Issues to report a vulnerability ([Issues](https://github.com/thaddeuskkr/Kana/issues)). If you find something that you would be able to fix yourself, you are free to fork and edit this code, then open a pull request ([Pull Requests](https://github.com/thaddeuskkr/Kana/pulls)) and wait for your changes to be approved and merged. You will most likely get a response in a few days. If your vulnerability is accepted, you will have my eternal thanks. If you are, however, denied, you can always try again another time.
